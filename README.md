## Getting Started

# Android history
There's a little bug starting with flutter ```3.7.1``` linked to android build, see [solution here]('https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/100756#issuecomment-1078988954')

We needed to change gradle version from 7.5 to 7.6 in ```android/graddle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties```.
